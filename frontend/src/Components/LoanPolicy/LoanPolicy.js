        Basically, loan portfolios have the largest effect on the total risk
        profile and earnings performance. This earning performance comprises of
        various factors like interest income, fees, provisions, and other
        factors of commercial banks.

        The mediocre loan portfolio marks approximately 62.5 percent of total
        centralized assets for banking organizations with less than $1 billion
        in total assets and 64.9 percent of total centralized assets for banking
        organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets.

        In order to limit credit risk, it is compulsory that suitable and
        effective policies, procedures, and practices are developed and
        executed. Loan policies should coordinate with the target and objectives
        of the bank, in addition to supporting safe and sound lending activity.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Policies and procedures should be presented as a layout for all major
        credit decisions and actions, enclosing all material aspects of credit
        risk, and mirroring the complexity of the activities in which a bank is
        engaged.<br></br>

        <h1 className= {styles.primaryHeading}>Policy Development</h1>
        <br></br>
        As we know risks are inevitable, banks can lighten credit risk by
        development of and cohesion to efficient and effective loan policies and
        procedures. A well-documented and descriptive loan policy proves to be
        the milestone of any sound lending function.
        <br></br>
        Ultimately, a bank{`’`}s board of directors is accountable for flaying
        out the structure of the loan policies to address the inherent and
        residual risks. Residual risks are those risks that remain even after
        sound internal controls have been executed in the lending business
        lines.
        <br></br>
        After formulating the policy, senior management is held accountable for
        its execution and ongoing monitoring, accompanied by the maintenance of
        procedures to assure they are up to date and compatible to the current
        risk profile.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h1 className= {styles.primaryHeading}>Policy Objectives</h1>
        <br></br>
        The loan policy should clearly communicate the strategic goals and
        objectives of the bank, as well as define the types of loan exposures
        acceptable to the institution, loan approval authority, loan limits,
        loan underwriting criteria, and several other guidelines.
        <br></br>
        It is important to note that a policy differs from procedures in which
        it sets forth the plan, guiding principles, and framework for decisions.
        Procedures, on the other hand, establish methods and steps to perform
        tasks. Banks that offer a wider variety of loan products and/or more
        complex products should consider developing separate policy and
        procedure manuals for loan products.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h1 className= {styles.primaryHeading}>Policy Elements</h1>
        <br></br>
        The regulatory agencies{`’`} examination manuals and policy statements
        can be considered as the best place to begin when deciding the key
        elements to be incorporated into the loan policy.
        <br></br>
        In order to outline loan policy elements, the bank should have a
        consistent lending strategy, identifying the types of loans that are
        permissible and those that are impermissible. Along with identifying the
        types of loans, the bank will and will not underwrite regardless of
        permissibility. The policy elements should also outline other common
        loan types found in commercial banks.

        Loan policies vary significantly from one bank to another. It is
        completely based on the complexity of the activities they are engaged
        in. The policy elements of a private bank may slightly differ from the
        government bank. Anyhow, a general loan policy incorporates specific
        basic lending tenets.
